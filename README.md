Immergo is an interactive language learning application powered by the **Google Gemini Live SDK**. It simulates real-world roleplay scenarios (e.g., buying a bus ticket, ordering coffee) to help users practice speaking in various languages with an AI that adopts perfectly reactive personas.

## Features

-   **Missions & Roleplay**: Chose from structured scenarios with specific objectives.
-   **Learning Modes**:
    -   **Teacher Mode**: Get helpful explanations and translations in your native language.
    -   **Immersive Mode**: Strict "No Free Rides" policy where you must speak the target language to proceed.
-   **Native Language Support**: Select your native language for tailored feedback and assistance.
-   **Proactive AI Persona**: The AI adopts a specific role (e.g., "Bus Driver", "Friendly Neighbor"). And will only speak when necessary.
-   **Real-time Multimodal Interaction**: Speak naturally with the AI, which responds with low-latency audio.
-   **Performance Scoring**: Get graded on your fluency (Tiro, Proficiens, Peritus) with actionable feedback (Immersive Mode).

## Tech Stack

-   **Frontend**: Vanilla JavaScript, Vite, Web Audio API, WebSocket.
-   **Backend**: Python, FastAPI, `google-genai` SDK.
-   **Communication**: WebSocket for full-duplex audio streaming.

## Prerequisites

-   Node.js (v18+)
-   Python (v3.10+)
-   Google Cloud Project with Vertex AI enabled.
-   Google Cloud Application Default Credentials configured.

## Setup

### 1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd immersive-language-learning-with-live-api
```

### 2. Quick Install
Run the installation script to set up both backend (Python venv) and frontend (Node modules) dependencies:
```bash
./install.sh
```

### 3. Environment Config
Create a `.env` file in the root directory:
```bash
cp .env.example .env
```
Update `.env` with your Google Cloud details if necessary.

## Running the Application

### Development (Hot-Reload)
Start both the backend server and frontend development server with a single command:
```bash
./dev.sh
```
This will:
- Start the Python backend on port 8000.
- Start the Vite frontend dev server (usually port 5173).
- Enable `DEV_MODE` (bypassing Redis/ReCAPTCHA).
- Allow you to access the app at `http://localhost:5173`.

### Production Build
To serve the built frontend via the Python server:

1.  **Build**:
    ```bash
    npm run build
    ```
2.  **Run Server**:
    ```bash
    python3 server/main.py
    ```
3.  Access at `http://localhost:8000`.

### 🚀 One-Click Production Deployment

The fastest way to get Immergo running in production is using Google Cloud Run:

1.  **Click the button below**:
    [![Run on Google Cloud](https://deploy.cloud.run/button.svg)](https://deploy.cloud.run/?git_repo=https://github.com/ZackAkil/immersive-language-learning-with-live-api)
2.  **Follow the prompts** in the Google Cloud Shell to authorize and deploy.

### 🛠 Manual Deployment (via `deploy.sh`)

If you prefer to deploy from your terminal, you can use the provided `deploy.sh` script:


### Advanced Configuration

To enable production features like metrics, bot protection, and scalable rate limiting, configure the following environment variables (defined in `server/simple_tracker.py` and `server/main.py`):

#### 1. BigQuery Metrics
To track session start and page view events in BigQuery:
-   `BQ_DATASET`: Your BigQuery Dataset ID.
-   `BQ_TABLE`: Your BigQuery Table ID.
-   `DEMO_NAME`: (Optional) Name to identify this app in the metrics (default: `your-app-name`).

#### 2. reCAPTCHA v3
To protect against bots:
-   `RECAPTCHA_SITE_KEY`: Your Google reCAPTCHA v3 site key.
    -   *Note: Ensure your Cloud Run URL is added to the allowed domains in the reCAPTCHA console.*

#### 3. Redis (Rate Limiting)
For scalable rate limiting across multiple container instances:
-   `REDIS_URL`: The URL of your Redis instance (e.g., `redis://10.0.0.1:6379/0`).
    -   *Note: If using Memorystore for Redis, ensure your Cloud Run service is connected to the same VPC network.*

## 🏃‍♂️ Get Started with Vibe-Coding in Google Antigravity

Build your own features, scenarios, or UI components in seconds using **Google Antigravity**. Whether you want to add a "Space Travel" mission or a new "Translator HUD," here is how to vibe-code your vision:

### 1. Open the Repository in Antigravity
Launch the workspace and point Antigravity to this folder. It will automatically ingest the `GEMINI.md` context file to understand the architecture.

### 2. Describe Your Vibe
Instead of writing boilerplate, just describe the feature you want.
*   *"Add a new mission called 'Mars Colony Arrival' where the AI acts as a customs officer."*
*   *"Make the splash screen heading pulse with a holographic glow."*
*   *"Add a 'Voice Select' dropdown to the HUD so I can pick Gemini's personality."*

### 3. Iterate via Live Preview
Use the `./dev.sh` hot-reloading server. As Antigravity writes the code, you'll see the UI update instantly. Tell it to *"make the buttons more glassmorphic"* or *"shift the layout down for better balance"* until it feels just right.

### 4. Deploy Your Build
Once you're happy with your changes, use the **One-Click Deployment** or use Antigravity's terminal to run `./deploy.sh` to push your build directly to Google Cloud Run.
